The iMode and WAP modification adds two new items to the footer of your website. Those two new items give links to the "[i]?imode[/i]" and "[i]?wap[/i]" functions, allowing mobile users to navigate around your website with a simpler theme. This mod does not add any new features, it just links to the existing ones.

[center][size=12pt][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size][/center]

The iMode and WAP mod installs through the package manager. It only edits one file, so nothing should go wrong in the installation. If anything does go wrong, use a [i]package parser[/i] and install it manually, it's not that hard.
